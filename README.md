# My CodeWars Solutions

This repo is a collection of my personal solutions to any and all challenges I feel like completing from CodeWars.com. At the creation of this repo, my focus is almost entirely on improving my R skills and a touch of SQL. However, I've also earmarked space for Python programming, and will hopefully branch into other languages in the near future.

The CodeWars site is set up such that I cannot view solutions for a challenge until I've successfully generated my own solution. Only then can I see how others completed the same problem. I've made it a point to identify approaches, functions, stylistic choices, or optimizations for each challenge I complete by reviewing/appraising 1-2 solutions provided by others.
