# Challenge outline

For this challenge you need to create a simple SELECT statement that will return all columns from the people table WHERE their age is over 50
people table schema

    id
    name
    age

You should return all people fields where their age is over 50 and order by the age descending




## My Final Query (accepted by CodeWars)

```{}
SELECT id, name, age
FROM people
WHERE age>50
ORDER BY age DESC;

```


## Other Solutions I Liked

```{}
SELECT *
  FROM people
  WHERE age > 50
  ORDER BY age DESC

```


People seemed to like the use of indentation, as well as capitalizing the SQL statements, as best practices
